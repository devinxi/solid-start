Making this work with Solid and Vite:

/route/path?action
/route/path?loader
/route/path

Loaders - useResource, createResource, useRouteData, responsible for getting data (GET resources), ideally want them running just on the servers, routes have default loaders, but components should be able to have loaders that a parent composes:

- progressive hydration: load all data on the server and each page transition is server rendered with the data
- with client js, loads initial page server rendered with data, for link,
  prefetch code, and then gets just data from server and renders in client,
  no real new HTML page

Actions - useAction, createAction, mutations are creations, deletes, updates

- progressive hydration: form rendering is important so that there is a form on the page so that any button inside can work with the submit action method.. default action is attached with a default Form component.. useFetcher renderes the form for its specific action.. the action route can render a page to work without js... the page would often contain a similar form as other route which was using the form as a subcomponent in a route
- with client js, we stay on the same page depending on the type of the action, do optimistic updates, with fetching data.., refetch all the resources on the page, and then render the page with the new data

Strongly typed routes

## Development

This project uses Docker to run a Postgres database and Prisma to bootstrap its tables and query the data. Before moving forward you'll need to [install and run Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Prisma is installed locally in the project's npm dependencies.

1. [Download this directory](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fremix-run%2Fremix%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fexamples%2Fpm-app), then `cd` into the project directory:

```sh
cd pm-app
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to create a new file `.env`:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Copy `docker-compose.example.yml` to create a new file `docker-compose.yml`:

```sh
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
```

4. Create a username and password for your database in `docker-compose.yml`. You can use any values you want here. For example:

```yml
environment:
  - POSTGRES_USER=chance
  - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yolo2022
```

5. Use the same username and password values to confingue your database URL in `.env`. [See the Prisma guide for PostgreSQL for more information.](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/postgresql#example). For example:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://chance:yolo2022@localhost:5432/pm-app?schema=public"
```

> NOTE: in a real app you wouldn't want the database URL and username/password to be committed to your repository. Those should be environment variables set via your hosting provider's dashboard/cli.

6. Install the project's dependencies with npm:

```sh
npm install
```

7. Make sure Docker is running (I like to use Docker Desktop). Once it's up, run the `db:start` script:

```sh
npm run db:start
```

8. Run the `db:reset` script to setup the project's database.

```sh
npm run db:reset
```

> **NOTE:** If you update the database schema, you'll need to run `npm run db:update` to update the tables.

9. Run the dev server to start your app on `http://localhost:3000`:

```sh
npm run dev
```
